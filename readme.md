# GraphQL Auth Examples

These are the complete code examples for the [article on my website](https://www.mitchalderson.com/securing-graphql-pt-1-basic-auth/), basic graphql auth.

Common files, such as the schema and types are stored at the project root.

Individual examples will have their specific implementations in their own directory.

## Running the project

All commands are ran from the project root.

First install dependencies with `npm run install`

To run a specific example, use the `start:<example>` command.

I.E.

```
npm run start:shield
npm run start:context
npm run start:resolver
```
